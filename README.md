This is a standalone demo of the *Customer List* module originally developed for a group project in CST2335 (Mobile Graphical Interface Programming) at Algonquin College.

This public version includes only my contributions. The full app involved multiple modules built by different team members.

## Features
- Add / Update / Delete customer info
- Local SQLite persistence
- Detail view and responsive layout
- Encrypted SharedPreferences
- Bilingual support: English & French

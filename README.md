## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.

A few resources to get you started if this is your first Flutter project:

- [Lab: Write your first Flutter app](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/codelab)
- [Cookbook: Useful Flutter samples](https://docs.flutter.dev/cookbook)

For help getting started with Flutter development, view the
[online documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/), which offers tutorials,
samples, guidance on mobile development, and a full API reference.

## Git Flow

master --> Stable production ready code.

develop --> Integration branch where everyone's work is merged.

feature branches (feature/EventPlanner, feature/CustomerList, etc.) --> Each team member creates a branch for their assigned page.

### Work Flow

1. Clone the Repository
2. Create a Feature Branch from develop Branch
3. Work on Your Page
4. Push Changes to Remote
5. Create a Pull Request to develop Branch
6. Merge into develop Branch and Resolve Conflicts if Needed
7. Final Merge to main for Release

### Best Practice

- Use meaningful commit message
- Sync your branch with develop branch often to avoid large conflicts
